- Implementation of connection pooling which uses blocking queue.
- Hikari connection pooling used in CH for Spring based services
- When saving to Disk of API server any standard library to leverage it or should we implement it ourselves in a File?
- Spooling = Flushing onto disk and reading it when required
- ProxySQL => Explore, proxy is aware of DB topology and takes care of routing

- "What doesn't need to be done in real time, should be delegated as much as possible"
- Use a message stream when message is to be consumed by different set of services

- No queue offers exactly once semantics. Need to maintain in DB whether to reprocess or not.

- Rest over Websocket in Enterprise Usecase:

Pros:
- Browsers have limit on number of concurrent connections they can make to same domain
- Connections will consume memory on web socket server if if no messaging has been happening

Cons:
- Less throughput because messages are bulky
- More 3WH will happen
