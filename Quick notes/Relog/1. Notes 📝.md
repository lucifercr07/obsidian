- Implementation of connection pooling which uses blocking queue.
- Hikari connection pooling used in CH for Spring based services
- When saving to Disk of API server any standard library to leverage it or should we implement it ourselves in a File?
- Spooling = Flushing onto disk and reading it when required
- ProxySQL => Explore, proxy is aware of DB topology and takes care of routing

- "What doesn't need to be done in real time, should be delegated as much as possible"
- Use a message stream when message is to be consumed by different set of services

- No queue offers exactly once semantics. Need to maintain in DB whether to reprocess or not.
- Implementation server sent events, realtime using `socket.io` 

### Week 2
- Shared and exclusive locks

- Rest over Websocket in Enterprise Usecase:

Pros:
- Browsers have limit on number of concurrent connections they can make to same domain
- Connections will consume memory on web socket server if if no messaging has been happening

Cons:
- Less throughput because messages are bulky
- More 3WH will happen

#### Week 3
- Load balancer algorithms:
  1. Round robin: Distribute the load iteratively, better to use when backend machines are of same configuration i.e RAM, CPU etc.
  2. Weighted round robin: Distribute the load iteratively but as per weights, better to use when backend machines are of uneven configuration i.e RAM, CPU etc.
  3. Least connections: Better to use when server having the high response time variance especially with Analytics application.
- Implementation of Load Balancer
- Implementation multi threads connecting multiple redis and trying to acquire lock

#### Week 4
- Distributed ID generator

- Flickr distributed ID generator: https://code.flickr.net/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/
- Snowflake
- SonyFlake: https://github.com/sony/sonyflake
- Instagram Snowflake implementation, below stored as Stored Procedures.
