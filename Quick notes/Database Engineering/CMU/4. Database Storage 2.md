- Disk oriented architecture where DBMS assumes that the primary storage location of the database is on non-volatile disk. DBMS manages movement of data between volatile and non-volatile memory.
- Page oriented architecture where database heap file is broken into pages and retrieved using the page directory.
	- Issues with page oriented design:
	1. Fragmentation of pages which requires compaction.
	2. Useless Disk I/O when reading pages lot of not required tuple come as part of page as disk I/O is block based thus entire page is read.
	3. Random disk I/O as different tuples can be spread across multiple pages leading to random I/O

- Log-structured storage is an alternative approach to the page-oriented architecture.
#### Log-Structured storage
- 2 valid operartions **PUT, DELETE**
- For every single operation we keep appending them to a file.

- When page gets full it's flushed to disk. And new page starts filling up.
- All disks write are sequential and on-disk pages are immutable.
- **GET** a tuple: DBMS finds the newest log record corresponding to that id, scanning log from newest to oldest. To speed up the process we can maintain an index that maps a tuple id to newest log record.
- Hash tables are not used and trees datastructure are preferred as they help in range scans.
- DBMS needs to do compaction to reduce wasted space. Compaction coalesces larger log files into smaller files by removing unnecessary records.
- Once pages are compacted we don't need to maintain order of events related to tuples/records in time. DBMS can instead sort the page based on id order to improve efficiency of future look-ups which is called **SSTables or Sorted String table**
- Types of compaction:
  1. Universal compaction
  2. Level compaction
  3. ![[Pasted image 20230511003225.png]]
- Compaction happens on pages already on disk not on in-memory pages.
- **Disadvantages**:
	- Write amplification: When doing lot of reads performance can be worse as it's cumbersome to find in the compacted file. 
	- Compaction is expensive

#### Tuple Storage
- A tuple is essentially a sequence of bytes. It's the job of the DBMS to interpret those bytes into attribute types and values.
- The DBMS's catalogs contain the schema information about tables that the system uses to figure out the tuple's layout.
- ![[Pasted image 20230516000211.png]]
- Fixed precision numbers: Numeric data types with (potentially) arbitrary precision and scale. Used when rounding errors are unacceptable.
- Large values: Are stored in separate overflow pages.
- BLOB storage: Some systems allow you to store a really large value in an external file. The DBMS cannot manipulate the contents of an external file. No durability and transaction protections.

#### System catalogs
- Metadata about what the database looks like e.g Tables, columns, indexes, views, users, permissions etc.
- Almost every DBMS stores the database's catalog inside itself (i.e., as tables).
- Wrap object abstraction around tuples. Specialized code for "bootstrapping" the catalog tables. We don't query this like the SQL it's done by procedural code.
- You can query the DBMSâ€™s internal `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` catalog to get info about the database.
