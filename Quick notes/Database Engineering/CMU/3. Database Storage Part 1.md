- DBMS assumes that primary storage location of database is non-volatile disk.
- DBMS components manage the movement b/w non-volatile and volatile storage.

- In some cases when we do sequential access on non-volatile storage it can be as fast as volatile access. Like when we want to read 1 MB of data and all data is present in single block.

#### How the DBMS represents database in files on disk
- ![[Pasted image 20230425011805.png]]
- Hardware page has guarantees to be written atomically.
- Large page sizes in DBs help in reducing the System I/O calls as DBMS can ask the OS to sequentially read large chunk of data at once at given offset.
- But side-effect of keeping large page size is suppose we want to read 1 tuple and it's size is 512 Bytes we need to read 16 KB and then maintain it in-memory to keep that page in there even though only 1 record was required.
- A heap file is an unordered collection of pages with tuples that are stored in random order.
- Advantage of having multiple files rather than single file to store all DBMS data are:
	- Can take file locks on smaller pages and not block other threads
	- Potentially reduce the blast area if file is deleted
- If database is not in single file we need to maintaing a **Page Directory** which is going to keep track of data pages in database files. Must make sure directory pages are in sync with data pages.
- The **Page directory** also keeps a bunch of metadata about available space, the no. of free slots per page, list of free/empty pages.
- Just like a hash table lookup for a given page it refers to offset on where to find the page

#### Inside structure of a Page
- Pages contain of  `Header` and `Data`
- Every page contains header of metadata about the page's contents.
	- Page Size
	- Compression info
	- Checksum
	- DBMS version
	- Transaction visibility
- Page Layout/Data can have two approaches:
	1. Tuple oriented approach
	2. Log oriented approach
- Tuple Orient approach
	- ##### Slotted pages 
		- We create slot array which will hold the size of tuple(row/record) and the location in page where the tuples are located. So when we try to fetch the tuple we just look into slot array find it's offset on page and retrieve from there.
		- Slot array has fixed size for each slot but tuples can have variable lengths.
		- Slot array will grow from start towards end of page and tuples will grow from end to start and when they reach each other the page is considered to be full.
		- If we delete tuple the fragmentation can be handled by compaction.

#### How to identify tuples
- Using Record Ids, which is a unique identifier.
- ![[Pasted image 20230509005824.png]]
#### What's inside a Tuple
- A tuple is essentially a sequence of bytes.
- It's the job of the DBMS to interpret those bytes into attribute types and values.
- It has two parts:
	1. Tuple header: ![[Pasted image 20230509011540.png]]
	2. Tuple data:![[Pasted image 20230509011725.png]]
- **Denormalized tuple data**: Is where foreign key references can be stored as part of same tuple. So the row along with the whole foreign key reference record can be part of same tuple. Potentially reduces the amount of I/O for common workload patterns but can make updates more expensive. ![[Pasted image 20230509012011.png]]
- In above image table `bar` has foreign key reference to table `foo's` `a` value and thus we denormalize and store it as part of same tuple.
