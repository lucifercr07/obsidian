- User only needs to specify what they want, not how to do it
- DBMS is responsible for efficient evaluation of the query. High-end systems have a sophisticated `QUERY OPTIMIZER` that can rewrite queries and search for optimal execution flows.
- Relational languages are of below types:
  1. DDL
  2. DML
  3. DCL - Data control language

- Also includes View definitions, Integrity & Refrential constraints and Transactions
- SQL is based on `bags`(duplicates) not on `sets`(no duplicates).

#### Aggregates
- An aggregation function takes in a bag of tuples as its input and then produces a single scalar value as its output.
- Aggregate functions can (almost) only be used in a SELECT output list. 
- AVG(COL): The average of the values in COL 
- MIN(COL): The minimum value in COL 
- MAX(COL): The maximum value in COL 
- COUNT(COL): The number of tuples in the relation
- `COUNT(COL_NAME), COUNT(*), COUNT(1)` all have similar performance as DB engines auto optimize it.
- One difference to note in above: `COUNT(COL_NAME) does count only non-NULL values whereas COUNT(*) simply returns all rows (that satisfy the WHERE condition)`

- GROUP BY

- HAVING
	- Filters result based on aggregation computation like a `WHERE` clause for a `GROUP BY`.

#### String Operations
![[Pasted image 20230418003233.png]]

- `LIKE` used for String matching. 
	- “%” matches any substrings (including empty). 
	- `_` matches any one character.

- SQL is a way to specify a query that can then be executed using relational algebra.

#### Output Redirection

#### Output Control
1. `ORDER BY
2. `LIMIT

#### Nested Queries
- Queries containing another queries
- Often difficult to optimize
- Inner query can appear anywhere in query
- Can add limitless inner queries ideally(obvio that stack can run out of space)

#### Window Functions
- A window function perform “sliding” calculation across a set of tuples that are related. Like an aggregation but tuples are not grouped into a single output tuple.

#### CTE (Common Table Expression)
- 
```sql
WITH cte_name as (SELECT 1)
SELECT * from cte_name;
```
