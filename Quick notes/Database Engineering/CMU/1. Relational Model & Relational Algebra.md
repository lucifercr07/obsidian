- Databases are organized collection of inter-related data that models some aspect of the real-world.
- Core components of most applications.
- Create a simple storage with flat files for storing Artists and their corres. albums with year of release
  1. We can use a CSV based file to do that
  2. Can have issue with "Data Integrity": 
     How to ensure data consistency?
     How to ensure an integer is integer not string?
     When deleting one Artist how to ensure the Albums get deleted?
  3. Can have issue with "Implementation":
     How to find a particular record?
     How to create a new application that uses same CSV?
     How to manage multiple threads writing to same CSV?
  4. Can have issue with "Durability":
     How to handle machine crash?
     How to replicate across machines for high availability?

#### DBMS
- DBMS allows applications to store and analyze information in a database.
- Supports the definition creation, querying, update, and administration of databases in accordance with some data model.

#### Data models
![[Pasted image 20230413015652.png]]
- Data model is collection of concepts for describing the database.
- Schema is description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.

#### Relational model
- Defines a database abstraction based on relations to avoid maintainance overhead.
- Store database in simple data structures (relations).
- Access data through high-level language, DBMS figures out best execution strategy.
- Physical storage left up to the DBMS implementation.
- SQL is declarative language.
- 3 Parts:
  1. Structure
  2. Data integrity constraints
  3. How access and manipulate database's contents.

#### Relational Algebra
- Relational Algebra is a set of fundamental operations to retrieve and manipulate tuples in a relation. Each operator takes in one or more relations as inputs, and outputs a new relation. To write queries we can “chain” these operators together to create more complex operations.
| Operators  | SQL equivalent |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Select        | SELECT *  |
| Projection      | SELECT with column vals     |
| Union      | (SELECT * FROM R) UNION ALL (SELECT * FROM S)     |
| Intersection      | (SELECT * FROM R) INTERSECT (SELECT * FROM S)     |
| Difference      | (SELECT * FROM R) EXCEPT (SELECT * FROM S)     |
| Product      | (SELECT * FROM R) CROSS JOIN (SELECT * FROM S), or simply SELECT * FROM R, S     |
| Join      | SELECT * FROM R JOIN S USING (ATTRIBUTE1, ATTRIBUTE2...)     |

- Relational model is independent of any query language implementation.

#### Document data model
- MongoDB, Elastic, Couchbase
- Idea here is instead of having data in separate relational model they try to match things together and embed objects in single object.
- Don't do joins across models like below

  - Instead embed the Albums with each Artist
