- Interesting notes around how the cardinality of index in composite index can affect the performance of query. Also how the operators involved in query matter when using composite indexes.
- `when a condition has equality checks (=) and range/inequality checks (>, >=, <, <=, IN), then the columns involved in the equality checks should be first in the index and the inequality columns afterward.`
