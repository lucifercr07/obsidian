- Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mev55LTubBY&ab_channel=NeetCodeIO
- Node cannot be in same set as neighbors then graph will be bipartite.
- Can be solved by BFS/DFS of graph.
### BFS approach
- We'll use an array with marking is as 1 for 1st set of nodes while -1 for other set of nodes, as we need to track if node has any of the neighbor in same set if Yes then it'll not be a bipartite graph.
- We use a queue and append 1st node to queue and then we mark it as even set node member with -1 and proceed.
- Now we keep popping nodes till queue is not empty and start visiting neighbors for each popped node
- If the neighbor node is not visited mark it as visited opposite to whatever is current nodes marking. Like if -1 then 1 else -1

class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        visited = [0] * len(graph)

        def bfs(i):      
            if visited[i]:
                return True

            q = deque([i])
            visited[i] = -1

            while q:
                cur_node = q.popleft()

                for neighbor_node in graph[cur_node]:
                    if not visited[neighbor_node]:
                        q.append(neighbor_node)
                        visited[neighbor_node] = -1 * visited[cur_node]
                    else:
                        if visited[neighbor_node] == visited[cur_node]:
                            return False
            
            return True


        for i in range(len(graph)):
            if not bfs(i):
                return False

        return True
