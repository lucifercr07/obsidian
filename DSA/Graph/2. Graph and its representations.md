- Consists of two components:
  1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
  2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(di-graph). The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.
#### Adjacency matrix:
- Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph.
- Let the 2D array be `adj[][]`, a slot `adj[i][j] = 1` indicates that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
- Adjacency matrix for undirected graph is always symmetric.
- Often assumed that edge of going from a node to itself has a cost of zero. That's why the diagonal of matrix will have all zero values.

### Adjacency list:
- Way to represent a graph as map from nodes to list of edges.
- An array of lists is used. The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices.
- An entry `array[i]` represents the list of vertices adjacent to theÂ _**i**_th vertex. 
- This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs.
