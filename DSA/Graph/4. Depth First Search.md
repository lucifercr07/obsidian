- Traversal algorithm which allows us to explore all the edges and nodes of a graph.
- Runs with a time complexity `O(V + E)`
- Algorithm starts at an arbitrary node which is marked as visited and moves to the adjacent nodes while marking them as we visit. Continue this loop until all nodes are visited.
- **Time complexity:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.  
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(V), since an extra visited array of size V is required.
- Advantages:
  - Memory requirements is linear in comparison to BFS as only the nodes on the current path are stored in stack.
- Disadvantages:
  - Not guraranteed to find a solution as it can delve much into one side forever, can be minimised by having a depth cutoff but it's difficult to know in advance depth cutoff for a given problem space. Thus, it can happen a DFS can keep executing forever.

##### DFS connected graph
```java
class Solution {
    // Function to return a list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.
    public ArrayList<Integer> dfsOfGraph(int V, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj) {
        // Code here
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        dfsUtil(adj, 0, visited, result);
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private static ArrayList<Integer> dfsUtil(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int v, boolean[] visited,
                                                ArrayList<Integer> result) {
        visited[v] = true;
        result.add(v);
        
        ArrayList<Integer> connected = adj.get(v);
        
        // System.out.println("connected: " + connected.toString());
        
        for (int visiting : connected) {
            if (!visited[visiting])
                dfsUtil(adj, visiting, visited, result);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
##### DFS disconnected graph
In case of disconnected graph there can be a case that the arbitrary node chosen will never be able to reach all the nodes. Hence while calling `dfsUtil` we'll call for each unvisited node once.
```java
void DFS() {
    // Mark all the vertices as not visited(set as
    // false by default in java)
    boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];

    // Call the recursive helper function to print DFS
    // traversal starting from all vertices one by one
    for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i)
        if (visited[i] == false)
            DFSUtil(i, visited);
}
```
