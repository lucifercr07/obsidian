#### Shortest path problem
- Given a weighted graph find the shortest path with least cost between node A and node B.
- Algorithms: BFS, Djisktra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall etc.

#### Connectivity
- Does there exist a path between node A to node B.
- Algorithms: Union find or any search algo like DFS, BFS.
  
#### Negative cycles graph
- Does my weighted digraph have any negative cycles?
- Algorithms: Bellman Ford, Floyd-Warshall

#### Strongly connected components
- Can be thought as self-contained cycle within a directed graph.
- Every vertex in a given cycle can reach every other vertex in same cycle.
- Algorithms: Tarjan's and Kosaraju's algorithm

#### Travelling salesman problem
- Given a list of cities and distances between them find the shortest path with minimal cost which visits all cities and returns to origin city.
- This is a [NP hard](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-np-completeness/) problem.
- Algorithm: Held-Karp and branch and bound algorithms.

#### Bridges/Articulation points
- Find number of bridges in a graph.
- A bridge/cut edge is **any edge** in a graph removal of which will cause increase in number of connected components in a graph.
- Bridges hint at weak points in graph theory.
- Articulation point is **any node** in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components in graph.

#### Minimum Spanning Tree
- Subset edges in a graph which is connected and edge-weighted
