- Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
- Vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes.
- Graph is composed of a set of vertices(V) and a set of edges(E). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).
- Vertices: Also known as node/vertexes of a graph.
- Edges: They connect two nodes of a graph.
- Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network.
- Types of Graphs:
  1. Null graph: Graph with no edges.
  2. Undirected graph: A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge.
  3. Directed graph: A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.
  4. Connected graph: A graph in which from one node we can visit any other node in graph.
  5. Disconnected graph: A graph in which at least one node is not reachable from a node is known as a disconnected graph.
  6. Cyclic Graph: A graph containing at least one cycle.
  7. Directed Acyclic Graph: A directed graph that does not contain any cycle.
  8. Bipartite Graph: Graph in which vertex can be divided into two sets such that vertex in each set does not contain any edge between them.
  9. Weighted Graph: A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight. Weighted graphs can be further classified as directed weighted graphs and undirected weighted graphs
  10. Complete graph: Graph where there is a unique edge between every pair of nodes. Worst case of graph as no. of edges are high. Helpful in testing algorithms.

## Tree v/s Graph
- Trees are the restricted types of graphs, just with some more rules.
- Every tree will always be a graph but not all graphs will be trees.
- LinkedList, Trees, Heaps all are special type of graphs.
- Rooted Tree: Tree with a designated root node where every edge either points away from or towards the root node.

## Representation of Graph
1. Adjacency Matrix
   - In this method, the graph is stored in the form of the 2D matrix where rows and columns denote vertices. Each entry in the matrix represents the weight of the edge between those vertices.

2. Adjacency List
   - This graph is represented as a collection of linked lists. There is an array of pointer which points to the edges connected to that vertex.

#### Comparison between Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List
- When the graph contains a large number of edges then it is good to store it as a matrix because only some entries in the matrix will be empty.
