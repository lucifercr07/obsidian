- Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/description/
- We need to note here that when we look at k distance the distance between `kth` node from left and start node from left is `k` while it's the same `k` distance between node from end and kth node from end.
- So what we can do here is iterate till kth node and then iterate the same node to end of list and the right node also keep doing next while we reach till end of list.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head.next is None or head is None:
            return head

        cur = head
        # k - 1 since it'll start from 0 and go till (k - 1) i.e k totally
        # Or we can also do (1, k) as `k` will be exclusive in that case
        for i in range(1, k):
            cur = cur.next

        left = cur
        right = head

        while cur.next:
            cur = cur.next
            right = right.next
        
        left.val, right.val = right.val, left.val
        
        return head
```
