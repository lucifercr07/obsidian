- Approach :
	-  Use Floyd's Cycle-Finding algorithm, fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer both starting at head of linked list.
	- When the two pointers meet, we know that there is a cycle in the linked list.
	- We then reset the slow pointer to the head of the linked list and move both pointers at the same pace, one step at a time, until they meet again.
	- The node where they meet is the starting point of the cycle.
	- If there is no cycle in the linked list, the algorithm will return null.
