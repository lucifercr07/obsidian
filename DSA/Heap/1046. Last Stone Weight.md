- Intuition: Since we have to maintain here always the largest stone weight so that we can crush with other one. Here max heap can be used. When `x != y` add that weight difference to maxHeap and heapify() which would be auto done in case we're using `PriorityQueue`

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
        if (stones.length == 0)
            return 0;

        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

        for (int stone : stones)
            maxHeap.offer(stone);

        while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
            int y = maxHeap.poll();
            int x = maxHeap.poll();

            if (y != x) {
                maxHeap.offer(y - x);
            }
        }

        if (maxHeap.size() == 0)
            return 0;

        return maxHeap.poll();
    }
}
```
