- Since here we can put atmost two people in 1 boat. We can sort the array and check from start and end two conditions:
	  - If `people[start] + people[end] <= limit`  increment `start` and decrement `end` and increase `boatCount`
	  - If `people[start] + people[end] > limit`  decrement `end` and leave `start` as it is, as that person will need to go on their own boat and increase `boatCount

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);

        int left = 0, right = people.length - 1, boatCount = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            int weight = people[left] + people[right];

            if (weight <= limit) {
                left++;
                right--;
                boatCount++;
            } else {
                right--;
                boatCount++;
            }
        }

        return boatCount;
    }
}
```
