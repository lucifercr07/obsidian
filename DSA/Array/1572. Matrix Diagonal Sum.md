- Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-diagonal-sum/description/
- Approach:
	- Two diagonals are there, out of which primary diagonal is nothing but wherever in matrix row and column values are same i.e `i = j` .
	- Coming to secondary diagonal we can see that row values are same as primary diagonal. For the column values if we start from top right as we go down the matrix it decreases by 1. Here we can assume that row will be `i` and column value will be `mat.length - 1 - i(which is changing every iteration)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int diagonalSum(int[][] mat) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i  < mat.length; ++i) {
            sum += mat[i][i]; // Primary diagonal
            sum += mat[i][mat.length - i - 1]; // Secondary diagonal
        }

        return (mat.length % 2 == 0) ? sum : sum - (mat[mat.length / 2][mat.length / 2]);
    }
}
```
