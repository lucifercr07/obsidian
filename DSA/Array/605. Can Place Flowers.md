- Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/description/
- Implementation details:
  - We check for the places where `0` is there and check the prev and next values must be zero if yes then mark the place with `1` and increase the count.
  - One edge case here is that when checking for start and end position we don't need to check for prev. `i - 1` and `i + 1` indexes respectively.
- Code:
  ```java
  class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; ++i) {
            if (flowerbed[i] != 0) {
                continue;
            }

            // In case of flowerbed is 0 that means we can check for plantation
            int prev = (i == 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) ? 0 : 1;
            int next = (i == flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] == 0) ? 0 : 1;

            if (prev == 0 && next == 0) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                count++;

                if (count == n) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return count >= n;
    }
}
```
