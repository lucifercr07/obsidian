- Solution process: The question is a bit confusing here we have to make the arrays maximum value to minimize as much as possible based on given operations.
  Looking at it closely we want to average out the array to a value such that max value becomes minimized.
  We can only perform operation to prev element of any current element so here we can average out till current element each time and if the average is large than currentMax we thought that means we need to update our currentMax to the average amount else continue.
  We need to do a `ceil` always as there can be a case where the `i + 1` is not able to divide the `prefixSum/averaged out elements till curr` in that case we should take the `ceil` val as with `int` division it'll round it off to floor val.
  ```java
  class Solution {
    public int minimizeArrayValue(int[] nums) {
        long max = nums[0];
        long prefixSum = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            int currentNum = nums[i];
            prefixSum += currentNum;

            if (currentNum > max) {
                max = Math.max(max, (long) Math.ceil((double)(prefixSum) / (i + 1)));
            }
        }

        return (int) max;
    }
}
```
