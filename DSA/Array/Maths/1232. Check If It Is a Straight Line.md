- To check if points are in straight line we can check the slope of line and that should be same for all the points on the line, which can be done as below.
```
// Slope of line formed by 
// two points (y2, y1), (x2, x1)

Slope of Line = y2 - y1
               ---------
                x2 - x1
```
- Here since we're given bunch of points in an array, we can find slope value for first two points as `dy/dx` and then utilise that value to compare with other points so if we keep comparing with other points we can see `dx * (y2 - y1) == dy * (x2 - x1)` here we already have got `dx` and `dy` from comparing first two points and we can keep changing `x2, y2` as we proceed in array and if we enquire any point which doesn't equate in value return `False`

```python
class Solution:
    def checkStraightLine(self, coordinates: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        if len(coordinates) <= 1:
            return True

        x1 = coordinates[0][0]
        y1 = coordinates[0][1]
        x2 = coordinates[1][0]
        y2 = coordinates[1][1]

        dx = (x2 - x1)
        dy = (y2 - y1)

        for point in coordinates:
            if dy * (point[0] - x1) != dx * (point[1] - y1):
                return False

        return True

```
