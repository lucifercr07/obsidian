- Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-zero-filled-subarrays/description/
- Implementation:
  1. Point to note here is that count number of consecutive zeroes in array.
  2. And then there is a pattern that given `n` consecutive number of zeroes there can be multiple different size subarrays be created and that can be derived the pattern **(n * (n + 1)) / 2**.
- Solution:
  ```java
  class Solution {
    public long zeroFilledSubarray(int[] nums) {
        long countConsecutiveZeroes = 0, result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                // increment count for 0's
                countConsecutiveZeroes++;
            } else {
                // Count number of subarrays can be created from given consecutive count
                result += (countConsecutiveZeroes * (countConsecutiveZeroes + 1)) / 2;
                countConsecutiveZeroes = 0;
            }
        }

        // At end we need to calculate again as it might be that 0's extend till end of array
        if (countConsecutiveZeroes != 0)
            result += (countConsecutiveZeroes * (countConsecutiveZeroes + 1)) / 2;

        return result;
    }
}
```
