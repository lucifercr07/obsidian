Submission: https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/submissions/

- Similar to climbing stairs problem
- You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.
- One thing to note here is that either 0 or 1 we need to choose whichever is minimum step.
- Recursive problem we can look at is that we can start from end/top stair and cost for that'd be 0.
