Summary:
- We need to understand here that at each stair we have two choices either climb 1 or climb 2.
- If we start from end stair we have only one choice and same goes for stair prev. to the last stair
- Now when we look at the n-2 th stair the ways to go to n from their would be sum(ways from n -1th stair + ways from nth stair)
