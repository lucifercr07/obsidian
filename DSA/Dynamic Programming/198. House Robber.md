- This problem can be treated as find max value of every subarrays loot before given point. e.g.
  [1, 2, 3, 1, 5] => In this case if we start with 1 as house we can say what is max(2, 1 + rob([3, 1, 5]))
  If we start with 2 as house we can say what is max(3, 2 + rob([1, 5]))
- Recursive solution can be written as:
```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        return robHouses(nums, nums.length - 1);
    }

	private int robHouses(int[] nums, int size) {
		if (size < 0)
			return 0;

		// Either rob (current house and check for max loots before current house) or (check max loots till adjacent houses)
		return Math.max(robHouses(nums, size - 2) + nums[size], robHouses(nums, size - 1) );
    }    
}
```

- Memoized solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int[] memo = new int[nums.length + 1];
        memo[0] = 0;
        memo[1] = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            int currentVal = nums[i];
            // Either pick the current house and all loot previously before
            // the adjacent house or just pick the max adjacent house loots till then
            memo[i + 1] = Math.max(currentVal + memo[i - 1], memo[i]);
        }

        return memo[nums.length];
    }
}
```
