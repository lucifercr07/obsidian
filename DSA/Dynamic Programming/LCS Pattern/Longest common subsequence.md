- Problem statement: Given two strings, **S1** and **S2**, the task is to find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of the strings. 
	**Note:** A subsequence of a string is a sequence that is generated by deleting some characters (possibly 0) from the string without altering the order of the remaining characters. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, etc are subsequences of the string “abcdefg”.
- In longest common subsequence we can't find by skipping characters as in Longest common substring.

### Recursive solution:
- Things to ponder in recursive call
  1. Base condition - Think of smallest valid input
  2. Choice diagram
  3. Try to make input small
- Recursive function
  ```java
  int lcs(String s1, String s2, int n, int m) {
	// Base condition
	if (n == 0 || m == 0)
		return 0;

	if (s1.charAt(n - 1) == s2.charAt(m - 1))
		return 1 + lcs(s1, s2, n - 1, m - 1);

	return Math.max(lcs(s1, s2, n, m - 1), lcs(s1, s2, n - 1, m));
  }
```
