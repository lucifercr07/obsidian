- Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/description/
- Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/submissions/917690900/
- Here we just need to understand that since this is a circular array if we rob the first house we need to leave the last house and vice-versa.
- So we calculate with same maxRob function as `198. House Robber` but here we calculate max(maxRob(arr[0:arr.length - 1], arr[1, arr.length])) i.e. max robbery including the first house or max robbery excluding first and including last house.
