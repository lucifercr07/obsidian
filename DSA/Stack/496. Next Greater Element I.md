Observations:
- In this question we need to create a stack with decreasing sequence. To create that we need to make sure that whenever we encounter condition where  `num > stack.peek()` that means now we've seen element which is next greatest than current ones so keep popping till the scenario is that and once the condition is false or stack is empty we'll exit and push the num to stack.
- Another thing to keep track of popped element next greatest which is current element itself we can store that in map and since the question says `-   All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.` hence it shouldn't be an issue of loss of data here.
