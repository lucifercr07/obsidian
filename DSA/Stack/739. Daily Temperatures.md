- Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/solutions/109832/java-easy-ac-solution-with-stack/

- ***Observations***:
1. Problem related to monotnuc stack
2. Point to note here is that since the array can have duplicate values we need to store indexes in stack.
3. This problem is a variant of [Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/description/). In that problem, you are required to find the first next greater element while in this problem you are required to find the index difference from the current element to the first next greater element. 
   Suppose `temperatures = {60, 59, 61}`, in Next Greater Element I, the next greater element for `60` is `61`. So you will return `61` for `60`. In this problem, you will return the index difference of the next greater element instead: `60` is at index `0` and `61` is at index `2`, so you will return `2 - 0 = 2` for `60`.
