- Concurrency whilst waiting doing something else, includes parallelism
- Parallelism using multiple cores to complete a task
- Parallel streams supposed to be used for manipulating data/calculations, not supposed to be done for IO.

  - Concurrency is hard to get right, lot synchronised can lead to deadlock and resource contentions.
  - Few laws to keep in mind while writing concurrent code:
	  1. The Law of the Sabotaged Doorbell - Instead of arbitrarily suppressing interruptions, manage them better. 
	  2. The Law of the Distracted Spear fisherman - Focus on one thread at a time. Don't spin up too many threads at once unnecessarily and keep track of Platform threads. Tough to be done with Virtual Threads now as there can be millions of them ðŸ˜…. `jstack` tool can be used to get thread dumps.
	  3. The Law of the Overstocked Haberdashery â€“ Having too many threads is bad for our application. Performance will degrade and debugging will become difficult.
	  4. The Law of the Blind Spot â€“ 
	  5. The Law of the Leaked Memo â€“ 
	  6. The Law of the Corrupt Politician â€“ 
	  7. The Law of the Micromanager â€“ 
	  8. The Law of Cretan Driving â€“ 
	  9. The Law of Sudden Riches â€“ 
	  10. The Law of the Uneaten Lutefisk
